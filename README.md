===========================================

**Attempts were made to complete 3 of the 7 prompts!**
> *Challenge 1 was prompt 1 setting up the menu app for the restaurant!*
> 
> **Challenge 2 was prompt number 2, which was having fun with queues**
> 
> *Challenge 3 was prompt 4, helping the firm create their outings and seeing their expenditures*
